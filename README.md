# Team Profile Generator 

This app is designed for users to create team profiles through the command line. 
The user will answer the questions in the prompt, which will have them fill out information 
for either a manager, engineer or intern. The user can either continue to add members to the page 
or finish. Once the user finishes, the index page is generated and all of the information is printed. 

This app uses the inquirer and fs packages to run the prompt and write an index file, respectively. The app also uses
jest to test the manager, engineer and intern classes.
